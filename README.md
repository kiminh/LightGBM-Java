LightGBM-Java
=============
A simple example of [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) Java Wrapper

Users may need to [build Java Wrapper](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html#build-java-wrapper) by themselves instead of using pre-built files in the repo. The example includes the following tasks in Java:
 * Create a LightGBM dataset from float arrays;
 * Initialize a LightGBM booster;
 * Read a LightGBM booster from string;
 * Train a LightGBM booster;
 * Generate predictions from a LightGBM booster;
 * Output a LightGBM booster as string.

The code has been tested with LightGBM 2.3.*.
